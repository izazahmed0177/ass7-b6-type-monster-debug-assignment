                <h2>1.What is the difference between local storage and session storage in browser ?</h2>

                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold">Local storage</span> is the most recent mechanism. It allows for larger
                    amounts of data to be stored, but the data is not deleted when the browser is closed. Local storage
                    is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="fw-bold"> Session storage</span> is similar to cookies, but the data is only stored for
                    the current session. This means that the data will be deleted when the user closes the browser.
                    Session storage is useful for storing data that is sensitive, such as login credentials.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <h4>Local Storage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Most web applications these days require some type of user input, whether it be for a username,
                        shipping address, or even just a preferences setting. This input is then usually sent off to a
                        server somewhere to be processed and stored. However, what if your application needs to store
                        data locally on the user's computer? This is where Local Storage comes in.
                        <br>
                        Local Storage is a type of web storage that allows JavaScript to store and access data right in
                        the browser. This is especially useful for storing data that you want to persist even if the
                        user closes the browser, such as preferences or settings.
                        <br>
                        The data in Local Storage is stored in key/value pairs. The key is like the name of the data,
                        and the value is like the actual data itself. You can think of it as a variable in JavaScript.
                        To store data in Local Storage, you first need to create a key. Then you can store any data you
                        want under that key.
                        <br>
                        To create a key, you use the setItem() method. This method takes two arguments, the first is the
                        key, and the second is the value you want to store.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-success">
                        localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have a key, you can store any data you want under that key. The data you store can
                        be any data type that JavaScript supports, including strings, numbers, objects, and arrays.

                        To store data, you use the setItem() method again. This time, you pass in the key as the first
                        argument and the data you want to store as the second argument.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-success">
                        localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        To retrieve data from Local Storage, you use the getItem() method. This method takes the key as
                        an argument and returns the data that is stored under that key.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-success">
                        localStorage.getItem('key');
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        If you want to remove an item from Local Storage, you use the removeItem() method. This method
                        takes the key as an argument and removes the data that is stored under that key.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-success">
                        localStorage.removeItem('key');
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h4>Session Storage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Session Storage is a type of web storage that allows web applications to store data locally
                        within the user's browser. Unlike cookies, data stored in session storage is specific to the
                        site on which it was created and data is not shared with other sites.
                        <br>
                        Session Storage is a new feature introduced in HTML5 that allows you to store data locally in
                        the user's browser. Unlike cookies, data stored in session storage is specific to the site on
                        which it was created and data is not shared with other sites.

                        Session Storage is a way of storing data on the client side of an application. It's similar to
                        local storage, but with a few key differences -
                        <br>
                        1. Session Storage data is only available to the site that created it.
                        <br>
                        2. Session Storage data is not shared with other sites.
                        <br>
                        3. Session Storage data is not persistent, meaning it is only available for the duration of the
                        user's session on a site.
                        <br>
                        4. Session Storage data is specific to the browser tab in which it was created.
                        <br>
                        Session Storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications by reducing
                        the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the client and server. It can also be
                        used to store data in a more secure way since the data is not stored in cookies where it can be
                        accessed by third-party sites.
                        <br>
                        To use Session Storage in your web applications, you'll need to use the sessionStorage object.
                        This object provides access to the current session's storage.
                        <br>
                        The sessionStorage object has two methods
                        <br>
                        setItem() - This method sets a key/value pair in the session storage.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-success">
                        sessionStorage.setItem("name", "tutorialsPoint");
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        getItem() - This method retrieves the value of a key from the session storage.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-success">
                        var name = sessionStorage.getItem("name");
                    </div>
                    <p>

                        The sessionStorage object also has a couple of other properties -
                        <br>
                        1. length − This property returns the number of key/value pairs in the session storage.
                        <br>
                        2. key() − This method accepts an index as a parameter and returns the key at that index in the
                        session storage
                        <br>
                        Session Storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications and store
                        data in a more secure way.
                    </p>

                <h2>2.Difference Between Arrow Function and Regular Function ?</h2>
                <p>An arrow function is also known as the fat arrow function. It is a new feature introduced in ES6 that
                    is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. Both regular JavaScript functions and
                    arrow functions work in a similar manner but there are some differences between them. <br> Let's see
                    the
                    differences below: -</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Syntax</li>
                    <li>Arguments binding</li>
                    <li>Use of this keyword</li>
                    <li>Using a new keyword</li>

                </ul>
                <h4>1) Syntax:</h4>
                <p>A programmer can get the same result as regular functions by writing a few lines of code using arrow
                    functions.</p>
                <p>Curly brackets are not required if only one expression is present.</p>
                <div class="text-success">
                    // Regular function ES5: br
                    var add = function(a, b) { return a + b;};
                    <br>
                    // Arrow function ES6
                    <br>
                    let add = (a, b) => { return a + b};
                    <br>
                    //or
                    <br>
                    let add = (a, b) => a + b;
                </div>

                <h4>2) Arguments binding</h4>
                <p> object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments.</p>
                <div class="text-success">
                    // Object with Regular function
                    <br>
                    let showData = {
                    <br>
                    showArg: function(){
                    <br>
                    console.log(arguments);
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    showData.showArg(1,2,3);
                    <br> // output {0:1,1:2,2:3}
                </div>

                <p>The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments
                    binding.</p>
                <div class="text-success">

                    // Object with Arrow function
                    <br>
                    let showData = {
                    <br>
                    showArg: ()=>console.log(arguments);
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    showData.showArg(1,2,3);
                    <br>
                    // Uncaught ReferenceError: arguments is not defined
                </div>

                <p>But you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args.</p>
                <div class="text-success">
                    // using rest parameters
                    <br>
                    let showData = {
                    <br>
                    showArg: (...args)=>console.log(args);
                    <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    myFunc.showArgs(1, 2, 3, 4); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
                </div>

                <h4>3) Use of this keyword</h4>
                <p>Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the
                    value of this depends on how the function is invoked.</p>
                <p>The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the regular function’s
                    this behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.
                    <br>
                    The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function
                    and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function which means No
                    matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value
                    from the outer function.
                </p>

                <h4>4) Using a new keyword</h4>
                <p>Regular functions are constructible and callable. They can be called using the new keyword.</p>

                <p>But, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e., arrow functions can never be
                    used as constructor functions.</p>

            </div>

        <section class="m-5">
            <div class="container text-bg-light p-5">
                <h2>3.Difference between forEach, map and filter, find ?</h2>
                <p>Array functions are something that can help you with any type of manipulation or looping through an
                    array of items in JavaScript. Some of the pre-built functions can have very similar use cases to one
                    another, therefore I have created a list of manipulation functions, with how they look and their use
                    cases.</p>

                <h4>1 .forEach()</h4>
                <p>Function .forEach() is another form of just a plain for loop that can be used to iterate through
                    array items. This case of a function is used for more complex arrays, for example, an array of
                    objects with a lot of entries than just an array of integers.
                    <br>
                    This function takes 1 parameter .forEach(callback). The parameter callback can take up to 3
                    parameters element, index & array (but only the element parameter is required, the rest is
                    optional).
                    <br>
                    The parameter element will be used as a variable that stores the current element in the array.
                    Parameter index refers to the element's index in the array and the parameter array points to the
                    array that it was called on.
                    <br>
                    I do have to say that the newer prebuilt loop for..of in JavaScript is way more efficient than the
                    .forEach() in code clarity and its performance.
                </p>
                <h4>2 .map()</h4>
                <p>Function .map() is a manipulative function that can modify each element's content in an array that it
                    is called on. This function returns a new array with modified values, the array that it is called on
                    will stay still. This function is useful for adding a little change to an already existing array,
                    for example adding a property to an object or modifying it. Its construction and use are identical
                    to the previous function .forEach() and both can be used interchangeably.
                    <br>
                    Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter .map(callback). The
                    parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element
                    parameter is required, the rest is optional).
                </p>

                <h4>3 .filter()</h4>

                    Function .filter() is a search function that returns all the elements that fulfil the assigned
                    condition. You can search by simple terms, for example, that element is equal to a certain integer,
                    or by more advanced terms, for example, searching for an object with certain property that is equal
                    to something. Both examples have a very frequent use as a developer.

                    This function returns an array of found results, if any, even if only 1 match is found. If a
                    function does not find any match, it simply returns an empty array.
                    <br>
                    Just like the function .forEach(), this function also takes only 1 parameter .filter(callback). The
                    parameter callback can take up to 3 parameters element, index & array (but only the element
                    parameter is required, the rest is optional).

                <h4>4 .find()</h4>
                <p>Function .find() is also a search function like the previous but they differ in one small detail —
                    this function returns only one match in an array. If in an array is more than one result, the
                    function will return the first that has matched.

                <h2>4. Why we use template string in javascript ?</h2>

                <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us
                    insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in
                    older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic
                    elements. Another great thing that comes with template strings are tags. Tags are functions that
                    take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as parameters and are great for converting
                    strings to different entities.
                    <br>
                    The syntax for creating template strings is by using backticks to delimit them. For example, we can
                    write:
                    <br>
                    <span class="text-success">`This is a string`</span>

                    <br>
                    This is a very simple example of a template string. All the content is constant and there are no
                    variables or expressions in it. To add variables and or expressions to a string, we can do the
                    following.
